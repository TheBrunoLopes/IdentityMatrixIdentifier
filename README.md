# IdentityMatrixIdentifier
Simple 8x3x8 neural network that identifies rows of an identity matrix. Uses Keras with the TensorFlow backend

The main.py file is a program that:
  
  a. Creates and initializes a 8x3x8 neural network
  
  b. Trains the network to learn the 8x8 identity matrix
  
  c. Outputs the neural network prediction for every row of
    the 8x8 identity matrix
